# Healthcare Data Analysis and Visualization

Welcome to the Healthcare Data Analysis and Visualization project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of healthcare data, leveraging Python to uncover trends and insights through statistical analysis and visualization.

## Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to:
- Perform statistical analysis on healthcare data
- Analyze and interpret data trends
- Create visualizations to represent key findings

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: For basic data visualization
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical graphics
- **Plotly**: For interactive plots

## Project Sections

### Data Analysis

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics of each column in the dataset.
2. **Value Counts**: Frequency of unique values in categorical columns.
3. **Doctor with Most Patients**: Identification of the doctor with the highest number of patients.
4. **Oldest Patient**: Details of the oldest patient in the dataset.
5. **Youngest Patient**: Details of the youngest patient in the dataset.
6. **Monthly Admissions**: Analysis of monthly admissions, categorized year-wise.

### Data Visualizations

Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, we create various visualizations to understand the data better:

1. **Line Plot**: Trends of monthly admissions over the years.
2. **Pie Chart**: Distribution of patients by medical condition.
3. **Bar Graph**: Average age for each admission type.
4. **Boxplot**: Medical conditions statistics by gender.
5. **Pie Chart**: Percentage of patients by blood type.
6. **Categorical Plot**: Billing amounts for each admission type categorized by gender.
7. **Box Plot**: Statistics of medical conditions among patients.
8. **Box Plot**: Statistics of blood types among patients.
9. **Bar Graph**: Patient count for each insurance provider.
10. **Categorical Plot**: Patient count by admission type and medical condition.
11. **Distribution Plot**: Test results distribution by medical condition.
12. **Stacked Bar Plot**: Distribution of medical conditions by gender.
13. **Stacked Bar Plot**: Distribution of test results by admission types.
